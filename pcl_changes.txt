The following changes have to be made to PCL before the registration source code can be compiled.

I am assuming that the base folder for the pcl source code is /home/user/pcl. 

The following files have to be changed for the registration source code to work. 
1) /home/user/pcl/registration/include/pcl/registration/icp.h
2) /home/user/pcl/registration/include/pcl/registration/impl/icp.hpp


Changes to icp.h
================

Add the following piece of code in icp.h

void disableRANSAC ()
{
        disableRANSAC_ = true;
}
 
This piece of code should be added after the following piece of code that will be seen in icp.h (around line 100)

IterativeClosestPoint ()
{
     // some code here
}

After this scroll to the bottom of icp.h. You will see a bunch of definitions like the following

using Registration <PointSource, PointTarget>::target_; 
using Registration <PointSource, PointTarget>::nr_iterations_; 
....
...
...
...

Add the following line at the end of these definitions (around line 140)

bool disableRANSAC_;

Changes to icp.hpp
==================

You will see the following line around line 150.

if (!sac.computeModel ())

Change the above line to the following

if ( disableRANSAC_ || !sac.computeModel ())


Save the files icp.h and icp.hpp. Recompile PCL and reinstall.

You should now be able to compile the source code for registration.
